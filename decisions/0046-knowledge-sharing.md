# 46. knowledge sharing

Date: 2017-12-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For a long time, we only have a few tech sharing in our company.
So we take a survey in October and get the willings of sharing details from the whole R&D team, subjects include: `Python`, `Java`, `database`, `spider`, `data analysis`, `automation`, `algorithm`, `project experience` and so on.
Absolutely, People always have the passion to attend sharing.

## Decision

There are a lot of ways to do sharing.

* Formal sharing
	* sharer prepare a specific topic with well design ppt
* Casual talking
	* people sit around a table and talk
* `Lean coffee`
	* participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking

Formal sharing need a long time for preparing, we have try, but have too few sharers.

Casual talking donâ€™t have good topics, as developer always too shy to talk.

`Lean Coffee` is a structured, but agenda-less meeting. Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for the meeting was democratically generated.

`Lean Coffee` talk a little time(less than 10 minutes) to prepare, but have the chosen topics for talking.

We decide make this every Monday from 7:30 to 9:00.

### How does Lean Coffee work?

1. Set up a simple Kanban;
2. What to Discuss;
3. Vote and Talk;

### Details

1. 3 columns: `To Discuss` `Discussion` `Discussed`;
2. Put topics in `To Discuss` with 1-2 sentences each other;
3. Vote (2 votes each) and order it;
4. Set an 8 minute timer;
5. Move the first item into `Discussion` and start talking;
6. Repeat;
7. 5 minutes left for 1-2 sentence takeaways each other.

## Consequences

After 5 sharings, we find some things need to improve.

* Less than 10 people to attend each time is better;
* If we have a sign-in form will be good;
* Everyone should write the topics and vote;
* Choose one people recording discussions we talked and write in wiki later.
